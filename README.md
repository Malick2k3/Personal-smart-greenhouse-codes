ðŸŒ¿ Smart Greenhouse Project
A collaborative IoT project that monitors and controls plant growth conditions in real-time using sensors, automation, and web technologies.

Overview
This Smart Greenhouse system uses a microcontroller with various sensors to collect environmental data (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light) and automatically control a watering system. The data is transmitted to a web dashboard for remote monitoring and control.

Features
Real-time Environmental Monitoring

Temperature and humidity tracking with SHT4x sensor

Soil moisture detection

Light intensity measurement

Automated Plant Care

Automatic watering system based on soil moisture levels

Configurable thresholds and timing parameters

Remote Monitoring

Web dashboard for real-time data visualization

Historical data logging and analysis

User-friendly Interface

Mobile-responsive web application

Visual indicators for plant health status

Technology Stack
Hardware
Arduino-compatible microcontroller (Wio Terminal)

SHT4x temperature and humidity sensor
